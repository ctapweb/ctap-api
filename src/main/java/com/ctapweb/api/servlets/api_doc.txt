Version: v1


For administration:

Access to the following resources all require admin priviledge, which should be passed in with the header:

	Authorization: BASIC base64_hashed_string

The hashed string can be created by running :
	
	$ bash64 user:password

which gives a string like "dXNlcjpwYXNzd29yZAo=". The accepted admin credentials are set in config.properties.


	GET /v1/db/, lists all the tables in db
	POST /v1/db/, creates all the tables in db
	DELETE /v1/db/, deletes all tables in db
	PUT /v1/db/, reinitializes the db, which means dropping all tables and recreating them.
